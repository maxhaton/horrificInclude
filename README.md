# horrificInclude
## Usage


## Reasons to never use this ever
* Likely incorrect implementation of relatively complicated C standard
* Potentially huge compile time memory usage 
* Guaranteed slower compile times for big headers

## Error? 
If something fails in a confusing way, check the syntax of the header with `-E`.
